Class :
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
It defines a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have.
Classes encapsulate data and functionality together.

Object :
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from that class.
Each object can have different values for the attributes defined in the class.
